# Advanced-Reliability-Concepts
Materials &amp; study resources for Advanced Topics in Reliability course from AFIT that I learned myself

ourse Learning Objectives
--------------------------

After completing this course, students will:

1.  Thoroughly understand the basic concepts on which statistical methods for life-data analyses are based, specifically:

    -   How life-data analysis methods differ from other statistical methods
    -   The importance of statistical censoring
    -   Differences between right, left, and interval censoring
    -   Why all data is interval censored data
    -   How to use nonparametric methods for fitting models to data

2.  Be able to implement maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, specifically:

    -   How to construct likelihood functions for various types of data
    -   How to fit data to a parametric model by maximizing likelihood functions analytically, graphically, and computationally
    -   The importance of ML estimation in the frequentist and Bayesian domains
    -   The purpose and importance of the relative likelihood and profile likelihood functions

3.  Understand various point and interval estimation techniques, specifically:

    -   How compute estimates for parameters and functions of parameters from data
    -   How to compute confidence intervals and credible intervals for parameters and functions of parameters from data
    -   How to apply the Delta method to compute uncertainty propagation for an arbitrary function of the parameters
    -   Advantages and disadvantages between various procedures used to compute confidence intervals

4.  Use software to analyze real-world reliability data and communicate the results of their analyses, specifically:

    -   Students will use R & RStudio to compute results from real-world life data
    -   Students will communicate analysis techinques and results together using [**rmarkdown**](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
    -   Students will build interactive plots and tables using [**shiny**](http://shiny.rstudio.com/)
